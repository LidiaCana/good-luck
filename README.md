# Good Luck

A raffle platform application where users can organize raffles or participate in them.

## Project Overview

Good Luck enables raffle organizers to create and manage raffles, while participants can browse, subscribe to, and purchase tickets for raffles.

Create an application where users can register as people who raffle off prizes or people who want to subscribe to a raffle.
Authentication can be done through an external service such as Auth0 or Clerk.

In the raffle organizers' dashboard, they can create raffles, set a price to subscribe to the raffle, set the raffle date, view statistics on the raffle price and earnings, see a history of raffles, and see how many people have bought tickets. They can create posts promoting the products and upload multimedia content. They can also manage their Stripe account.

In the user profile, users can view all available raffle posts, create posts if they win a prize, and see posts from other winners. They can buy tickets for a raffle. They will also be able to see a casino games tab (coming soon). They can manage their profile name and top up their wallet with virtual currency to buy tickets.
